      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I’m a Montessori Elementary teacher. 

        I’m a computer programmer.
        
        I make mobile apps that allow students, parents, and teachers to stay connected, whether they are in the classroom or exploring their world.
        
        More importantly I make apps that are engaging and easy to use.
        
        Think about the last time your child was “doing homeschool.” Did everything go smoothly? That’s what I do. . . I make apps that engage kids at their level and are so intuitive that parents/teachers do not need instructions to use it. We know the kids won’t need instructions; they can figure out any app ;</p>  


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target audience is made up of students and families that are working from home due to illness or vacation. This audience also includes teachers who are required to provide assignments and lessons to these students. These teachers have a minimum amount of time to plan, gather, and organize the materials needed for the at home activities. The students and families are not super eager to complete work while they are sick (totally understandable) and who wants to do school work while they are on vacation? Access will be through laptop, desktop, and mobile devices. </p>

      <h2>Classroom Adventures</h2>
      <p>
        We are exploring the principles of 'light.' We have realized that without light we are unable to see objects. We are searching for objects that provide their own light source: fire flys (bioluminescence), glow sticks, flashlights.  - - -  Fiesta, Fiesta, Fiesta!  - - - Our study of Mexico will culminate in a 'Cinco de Mayo' fiesta! Needless to say we are very excited. The fabulous firsties are hosting the event and are busy as beavers in their preparations. Making piñatas, decorations, and guacamole. We would much appreciate donations for our  little piñatas. Please keep donations to small individually wrapped candies, individually wrapped healthy snacks, or small trinket party toy. (This would need to fit into a very small piñata, about 4" x 6".)                -Please send in donations by Tuesday, May 3rd.-

        Ancient Greece was an interesting place to live. We learned that they believed in many gods and that each god had a special power or responsibility. We know that Ancient Greece was in Europe and was much larger than present day Greece. We know that present day Greece is on a peninsula in Europe and has many islands. We created  beautiful topographical maps of Europe. We then stretched our own creativity by designing and painting  a topographical map of an island that we imagined.

        <p>
          WOW! We are becoming responsible and compassionate leaders. We are examples to our classmates of curious, self-guided learners. We have fallen in love with Ancient Roman architecture. We are using arches and columns in designing and building models of ancient colliseums, homes, and temples. Some have included a few modern features that they feel are essential then and now. Some are adding 'people' to show the different social classes: patricians, plebeians, and slaves. We are learning that the ancient Romans experimented with democracy, allowing regular people to make laws rather than kings, emperors, pharaohs, etc.
